Homework 1:
Implements parallel dense-matrix multiplication using threads, benchmarking speedup vs sequential execution across matrix sizes.

Homework 2:
Implements thread-safe and single-threaded Lazy<T> ensuring single evaluation and minimal synchronization overhead.

Homework 3: 
Implements a simplified fixed-size thread pool (MyThreadPool) that manages concurrent task execution across worker threads. Each task (IMyTask<TResult>) supports result retrieval, continuation (ContinueWith), and exception propagation via AggregateException.
